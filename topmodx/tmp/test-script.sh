 # renna: rename multiple files according to several rules

 #if the first ($1) condition matches then we execute that portion of the
 #program and then exit

 #we now get rid of the mode ($1) variable and prefix ($2)

 # if none then its better not to do anything than rename some non-existent
 # files!!
