TopMod is a fun 3D modeling program originally developed at TAMU.
The repository at code.google.com has since been frozen, and work
seems to have been abandoned on it for many years.

This repo contains a git mirror of the original code from
code.google.com/p/topmod along with some fixes to get it to compile
on a more modern Linux system.

You can find the TopMod website at:
